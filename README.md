- Going to Anime Expo with dressing special costumes. 🥋

### 🥺 Afraid to
I don't like me at all. I've NEVER been confident. Since the day I tried cosplay for the first time on the 27th of July 2024 and went to the Anime Expo, I've finally discovered a love for myself. However, I still don't like myself most of the time.
